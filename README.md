## Description of the Project
Team projects in university courses often struggle with unequal contributions and lack of accountability. 
This project is a peer assessment system designed for university team projects. It allows students to evaluate their teammates' contributions on four dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. The goal is to promote accountability and provide valuable feedback to both students and instructors.
