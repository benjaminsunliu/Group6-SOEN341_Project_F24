# Group6-SOEN341_Project_F24
## Project Description
University team projects often struggle with unequal contributions and lack accountability. This peer assessment platform enables students to evaluate their teammates across four key dimensions, promoting accountability and offering valuable feedback for both students and instructors.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Four-Dimension Assessments**:
	- _Cooperation_: Evaluates a student’s ability to take initiative, communicate, assist peers, and contribute to meetings and project planning.
	- _Conceptual Contribution_: Assesses a student’s involvement in research, design, and contributing ideas.
	- _Practical Contribution_: Measures a student’s engagement and initiative in producing deliverables and providing constructive feedback.
	- _Work Ethic_: Examines a student’s attitude toward the project and peers and their ability to meet deadlines and project milestones.

- **Anonymous Peer Evaluations**: Encourages fair and honest feedback.
- **Peer Feedback Summaries for Instructors**: Helps instructors assess team dynamics and evaluate each student’s performance and contributions.
- **Personal Feedback Report for Students**: Offers students constructive feedback on their contributions, encouraging personal growth.

## Technology Stack
- **Node.js**
- **React**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB**

## User Roles
- **Students**: Can evaluate their teammates across the four assessment dimensions and access personal feedback reports.
- **Instructors**: Can create and manage teams from their course roster (with the option to import team lists as a CSV file). After students have submitted their peer evaluations, instructors may view and export individualised reports.
