Agenda:

We first started transfering hardcoded datas(student fname,lname, email, ID and phone) from the UI to the database( under database : tests, under collection : students), 
by adjusting the code on the "instructorDashboard.jsx". Datas are now available on the MongoDB Atlas.

Then the main task was discussed, we were introduced to multer, which is a middleware module designed for node.js, 
it is primarily used for handling multipart/form-data, which is the format used for file uploads, such as .csv files.

The import functionality was added to the back end, but not completed. 

Adjournment: 

We have decided to make another meeting together tomorrow on Discord server, to complete the task.
