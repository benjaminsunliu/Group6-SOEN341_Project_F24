Agenda
- Discussion about the plan for Sprint 3,
- Discussion regarding user stories from Spring 1 and 2, and unit testing
- Create user stories from Sprint 3's requirements on unit testing.
- Proposing two new features for the project. 



Discussion Points:

Discussion Summary For User Stories:
The team began by reviewing the existing user stories from the previous sprints (Sprint 1 and Sprint 2). The main focus was to ensure that we complete all deliverables for these user stories and move them into the completed tasks.
After completing the discussion on past user stories, we shifted our attention to planning for Sprint 3.
We revisited the features that were prioritized earlier and agreed on adding new user stories for features that we think will enhance the user experience.
Specifically, we decided to include a calendar feature that will allow users to schedule, track, and manage tasks/events. Additionally, a feature for "forgot password" functionality was proposed and agreed upon.
This would provide users an option to easily reset their passwords in case they forget them, which is an essential functionality for maintaining user access and security.

- Item 1: User Stories
	Discussion Summary: After discussion, we added new user stories to the Sprint plan acording to criteria for Spring 3. 
	Since we already had finished a proposed feature in the past sprints, we thought we'd add the calendar feature as well as a third feature which is an option to forget password.

	Decisions Made: Additional user stories on Sprint 3. We decided to work on the calendar and an option for password forgotten. 



Discussion Summary For Unit Testing:
In addition to breaking down the unit testing tasks for different components, the team also discussed which unit testing frameworks and languages would be best suited for our needs. 
After reviewing a few options, the team agreed to use Jest as the primary testing framework for the project.
Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that provides a simple and effective way to write tests, and it is well-suited for the web technologies we are using in the project.
The team considered other testing frameworks as well, such as Mocha and Chai, but Jest was chosen because of its integrated test runner, easy-to-use syntax, and fast performance. 
Additionally, Jest supports mocking and code coverage reports, which will be helpful for our unit testing tasks.
The decision was made to use Jest to test all the JavaScript-based components of the application, including the forgot password, login, create account, and assessment rating features. 


- Item 2: Unit Testing 
	Discussion Summary: We have decided to split the unit testing of different 3 components to different teams. 
	Decisions Made: A unit testing on forgot password, import/export, assessment rating, login feature, and create account.
