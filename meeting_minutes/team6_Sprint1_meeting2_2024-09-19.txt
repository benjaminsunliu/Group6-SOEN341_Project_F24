Discussion Points:
-Item 1: Assign different tasks of the project 
      Discussion:
          -As mentioned in the previous meeting, the project has been divided into 3 components: 1) UI design, 2) Server-side design, and 3) Database design.
      Discussion Made: 
          -Ella and Anthony will design the UI (front end) of the project
          -Jordan and Benjamin will both design the back-end and server architecture of the web
          -Mehrad and Mustafa will design the database of the project. All assignments will follow the requirements of Sprint 1.



-Item 2: Technology used by each group to build the final product
      Discussion: 
      Decision Made:
        -The team responsible for UI design will use React.js. 
        -The team responsible for the server-side component will use Node.js. 
        -The team responsible for designing the database will use MongoDB.


-Item 3: Clarification 
      Discussion:
        -After discussing with Professor Dargham, it was clarified that authentication is not necessary and can be based on assumption for the login process.
        -Different formats can be used for login IDs to prevent students from logging in as instructors.
        -As discussed before, for example: the student could login with :n_netname@live.concordia.ca format email and instructor could login with firstname.lastname@staff.concordia.ca format.
      Decision Made: use different login format for instructor and student/ discuss in the upcoming meeting


-Item 4: User Stories
      Discussion: 
          -The group gathered new ideas and added additional information to the User Stories for Sprint 1.
          -Story points, task priorities, and associated risks were discussed.


-Item 5: Issues related to the database and back-end component
      Discussion: 
          Database design : 
           -Two different groups (one for instructors, the other for students) will have different permission levels and visibility access.
           -Instructors will have permission to access all information, while students will have more restricted access (based on Sprint 1 description).

          Server-side design:
           -The server needs to be connected to the database and front-end. The server will access the front-end through its root directory.
           -The server will be connected to the front-end of the webpage, by accessing its root directory.
           -In the next meeting, the three components of the web project will be integrated.

      Decision Made: 
            -Furthur discussion in upcoming meeting
