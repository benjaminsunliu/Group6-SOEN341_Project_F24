Attendees: Mehrad Mostaan, Mustafa Alawadi

Agenda

We started by exploring both a localhost and a cloud-based database but decided to stick with localhost after the TA confirmed that a cloud option wasn't necessary. 
We've successfully tested storing user data submitted through an HTML form and are now looking into how to add other necessary data and establish a connection to the back end.



Next Steps
Upcoming Meetings: Another DB meeting spet 25 2024 to add other necessary data
